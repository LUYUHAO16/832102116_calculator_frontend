# Code Style Guide

## Introduction
This code style guide is based on mainstream official standards and recommendations from major companies. The main source of this code style guide is a combination of Google 's java programming conventions and general software development best practices.

## Language
The code is written in java and adheres to the java language standards and it is developed on Android studio.

## Naming Conventions
- **Package Names**: Use lowercase letters and reverse domain format, for example, com.example.myapp.

- **Class Names**: Start with an uppercase letter and use Camel Case, for example, MainActivity, CalculatorFragment.

- **Method Names**: Start with a lowercase letter and use Camel Case, for example, calculateResult(), setBackgroundColor().

- **Variable Names**: Start with a lowercase letter and use Camel Case, for example, resultValue, buttonClickCount.

- **Constant Names**: Use all uppercase letters with underscores between words, for example, MAX_VALUE, PI.

- **Resource File Names**: Use lowercase letters with underscores between words, for example, activity_main.xml, ic_launcher.png.

- **Resource ID Names**: Start with a lowercase letter and use Camel Case, typically matching the corresponding view name, for example, @+id/buttonCalculate, @+id/textViewResult.


## Indentation and Spacing
- Indentation: Use 4 spaces as the standard indentation.

- Line Width: It is typically recommended to limit each line of code to between 80 and 120 characters. This helps ensure good readability of code in various editors and screens.

- Empty Lines: Use empty lines between different code blocks and methods to enhance readability. For example, between class members and within method bodies.

- Braces: Braces should occupy their own line, and they should be indented within control structures such as if, for, and while statements.

## Error Handling

- Use Exception Handling: Use exception handling in your code to capture and manage exceptions, ensuring your application gracefully handles errors without crashing.

- Precise Exception Handling: Catch only the exceptions that you can handle effectively, avoiding catching all exceptions. This prevents hiding underlying issues.

- Log Error Information: Use logging to record exceptions and error details so that developers can trace and debug issues. In Android, the Log class is commonly used for logging.

## Database Connections

- **Use SQLite**: Android provides SQLite as a built-in database engine. It's recommended to use SQLite for local data storage and management as it's lightweight, efficient, and well-integrated into the Android framework.

- **Singleton Pattern**: Create a singleton class to manage database connections. This ensures that you have a single instance of the database connection throughout your app, preventing resource wastage and potential issues with multiple connections.
```java
public class DatabaseHelper {
    private static DatabaseHelper instance;
    private SQLiteDatabase database;

    private DatabaseHelper(Context context) {
        // Initialize the database here
    }

    public static synchronized DatabaseHelper getInstance(Context context) {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new DatabaseHelper(context);
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public SQLiteDatabase getDatabase() {
        return database;
    }
}
```
- **Open and Close the Database Properly**: Always open the database when you need it and close it when you're done. Leaving the database open unnecessarily can lead to resource leaks and degraded performance.
```java
DatabaseHelper dbHelper = DatabaseHelper.getInstance(context);
SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getDatabase();
// Perform database operations
db.close(); // Close the database when done
```
- **Use Transactions**: When performing multiple database operations as a single unit of work, wrap them in a transaction. This improves performance and ensures consistency.
```java
SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getDatabase();
db.beginTransaction();
try {
    // Perform multiple database operations
    db.setTransactionSuccessful();
} finally {
    db.endTransaction();
}
```
- **Avoid Long-Running Operations on the Main Thread**: Never perform database operations that may take a long time on the main thread, as this can lead to ANR (Application Not Responding) errors. Use background threads or asynchronous tasks for time-consuming database tasks.

- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling when executing database operations. Catch and handle database-related exceptions, such as SQLiteException, to provide appropriate feedback to users or log errors for debugging.
```java
try {
    // Database operation
} catch (SQLiteException e) {
    // Handle the exception, e.g., display an error message
}
```
- **Content Providers**: For sharing data between apps or ensuring data security and encapsulation, consider using content providers. Content providers offer a standardized interface for data access and can be useful when building more complex applications.

- **Upgrade Strategy**: Plan for database schema changes in your app's life cycle. When you need to modify the database structure, implement an upgrade strategy that ensures data migration or data preservation.

## Code Organization

- Package Structure: Create a well-organized package structure to group related classes and components. Consider using a package-by-feature approach, where classes related to a specific feature or module are grouped together in a package.
- Class Organization: Follow a consistent class structure. Typically, an Android class includes fields, constructors, Android lifecycle methods, other methods, and inner classes (if necessary). Use comments or regions to separate sections for better readability.
- Resource Files: Organize resource files (layouts, drawables, strings, etc.) into appropriately named directories. Use resource directories like layout, drawable, values, and create subdirectories within them when needed.

## Conclusion

This code style guide adheres to official standards and best practices in the industry. Following these guidelines will result in maintainable, readable, and reliable code.
